## Notes

- Traits with numbers (like Proven, Primitive, Devastating, Vengeful) should be written in the format: `TraitName (X)` where X is the numeric value
- Some traits have multiple variants (e.g., Twin-Linked can be "+10 bonus" or "X1 extra hit")
- The system automatically extracts and applies these traits when they are present in the weapon's Special field
- Traits are case-insensitive and support both English and Russian names
