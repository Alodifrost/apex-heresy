## What Makes Apex Heresy Special?

### **Complete Character Creation & Development**

Create your Acolyte from the ground up with an intuitive character sheet that guides you through every aspect of your character's identity. Choose your Home World, Background, Role, and Elite Advancements to craft a unique agent of the Inquisition. The system automatically calculates your characteristics, skills, and derived statistics, ensuring accuracy while letting you focus on bringing your character to life.

Track your character's growth through a detailed experience point system that allows you to advance characteristics, learn new skills, acquire talents, and develop psychic powers. Every advancement is tracked and calculated automatically, making character progression smooth and transparent.

### **Comprehensive Combat System**

Experience tactical combat that captures the deadly nature of the 41st Millennium. The system supports a wide variety of attack types:

- **Melee Combat**: Standard attacks, charges, swift strikes, lightning attacks, all-out assaults, and called shots
- **Ranged Combat**: Single shots, semi-automatic bursts, full-auto suppression fire, and precision called shots
- **Psychic Powers**: Bolt, Barrage, Storm, and Blast attacks with proper focus power mechanics

Combat calculations handle armor penetration, damage types (Impact, Energy, Rending, Explosive), critical hits, righteous fury, and location-based damage. The system automatically tracks ammunition consumption, weapon jams, overheating, and all the gritty details that make combat in Dark Heresy both challenging and rewarding.

### **Rich Equipment Management**

Equip your character with an extensive arsenal of weapons, armor, and gear from the Dark Heresy universe. The system includes:

- **Weapons**: From humble lasguns to devastating plasma weapons, chainswords to power weapons, with proper rate of fire, range, damage, and special traits
- **Armor**: Location-based protection covering head, arms, body, and legs, with different armor types (Flak, Mesh, Carapace, Power Armor)
- **Equipment**: Hundreds of items including auspexes, data-slates, medkits, and specialized tools
- **Weapon Modifications**: Customize your weapons with scopes, bayonets, and other enhancements
- **Ammunition**: Track different ammo types with varying damage and penetration values

### **Advanced Psychic Powers**

For those who walk the dangerous path of the psyker, the system provides comprehensive support for psychic abilities. Manage your Psy Rating, track sustained powers, and handle the risks of psychic phenomena. The system supports multiple psychic disciplines including Biomancy, Divination, Pyromancy, Telekinesis, Telepathy, and the forbidden arts of Maleficarum.

Each psychic power includes proper difficulty ratings, focus power mechanics, range, duration, and damage calculations. The system handles psychic tests, perils of the warp, and the constant danger that comes with wielding such power.

### **Deep Skill System**

Master over 20 core skills, each with multiple specializations. Whether you're investigating forbidden lore, navigating the void, or using tech, the system tracks your proficiency levels from Untrained to Veteran. Skills automatically calculate their values based on your characteristics and advancement levels, making skill checks quick and accurate.

### **Character Progression & Aptitudes**

The aptitude system ensures that character advancement feels meaningful and balanced. Track which aptitudes your character possesses, and use them to determine the cost of new abilities. This creates natural character development paths and prevents characters from becoming too powerful too quickly.

### **Corruption & Insanity**

The dark universe of Warhammer 40,000 takes its toll. Track your character's Corruption and Insanity as they face the horrors of the galaxy. The system automatically calculates bonuses and penalties based on these values, and supports tracking Malignancies, Mutations, and Mental Disorders that may afflict your character.

### **Critical Injuries & Conditions**

Combat in Dark Heresy is deadly, and critical injuries reflect that reality. The system tracks critical wounds by location and damage type, ensuring that a well-placed shot can be devastating. Additionally, track various conditions like being on fire, stunned, grappled, or poisoned, with automatic application of their effects.

### **NPC & Horde Support**

Game Masters can create and manage NPCs with the same depth as player characters. The system also includes special support for hordes—mass combat rules that allow you to handle large groups of enemies efficiently, making epic battles manageable and exciting.

### **Active Effects System**

Leverage Foundry VTT's powerful Active Effects system to automatically apply bonuses, penalties, and modifications from talents, traits, equipment, and conditions. This ensures that all modifiers are calculated correctly without manual tracking.
